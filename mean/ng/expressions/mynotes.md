## Expressions
The  { {  } } notation for showing a variable attached to a $scope is an expression.

- All expressions are executed in the context of the scope and have access to local $scope variables

- An expression doesn't throw errors if it results in a * TypeError or a ReferenceError *

- They do not allow for any control flow functions(conditionals)

- They can accept a filter and/or filter chains.
